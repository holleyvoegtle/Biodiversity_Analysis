# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Google Colab Notebooks. Some data analysis may be done via Javascript, but more in regards to displaying information on our dashboard and not for Machine Learning. 

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use. 

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to perform our linear regression. 

## Dashboard
We plan on using Javascript to create an interactive dashboard (tentatively) utilizing a variety of the following: Bootstrap, CSS, Plotly.js, D3.json(). Additionally, we want to great some visuals via Tableau and use the Javascript API to include them in our dashboard.
