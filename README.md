## Overview 
For our group project, we are looking at biodiversity in National Parks. We came to a consensus to choose this data set because we are all passionate about the environment.  
The selected dataset contains two csv files- one including species data and the other containing data on the parks themselves. 
More specifically, the species csv has information on classification of certain animals, which parks they can be found in, and how common they are among other things. 
The parks csv contains information on coordinates and acreage of the parks as well as which respective states they are located in. 

### Purpose 
We are investigating the issue of whether the proximity of a given National Park to an urban center has a significant effect on the number of invasive species in the national park.
